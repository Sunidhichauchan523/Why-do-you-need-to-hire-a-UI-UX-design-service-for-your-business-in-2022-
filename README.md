What do UI and UX mean? <br>
UI design and UX design are two of the most often conflated and confused terms in web design. UX design stands for “user experience design”, while UI refers to the term “user interface design”. Even though they are related to each other, their roles are quite different and refer to very different aspects of the product development process and the design discipline. Let us understand the meaning of these two terms and then consider the key differences between them. <br>

What is UX Design? <br>
‘UX’ stands for “user experience” and refers to the entire experience someone has with your product from start to finish. A user’s experience of an app or website is determined by how they interact with it. In other words, user experience can be determined by how easy or difficult it is to interact with the user interface elements created by the UI designers. This is why many people get confused between UX and UI design, however, while UI designers are in charge of deciding how the user interface will look, UX designers are tasked with determining how the user interface operates. <br>
UX designers determine the structure and functionality of the interface, namely, how it is organized and how all the parts are related to each another. Thus, UX designers design how the interface works. If it works well and feels seamless, then the user will have a good experience. If it is difficult to use or unintuitive, the user will then have a lousy experience. <br>

What is UI Design? <br>
The UI design stands for “user interface”, which is the graphical layout of an application. It consists of the buttons the users click on, the text they read, the images, text entry fields, sliders, etc., they interact with. This also includes the screen layout, transitions, interface animations and any other micro-interaction of the user with the website or app. In short, all kinds of visual elements, interaction and animation must all be designed by the UI designers. It is up to the UI designers to decide what the application is going to look like- they choose everything from color schemes and button shapes to the width of lines and the fonts used for the text. They are responsible for creating the look and the feel of an application’s user interface. <br>
So in other words, UI designers are graphic designers and are concerned with the aesthetics of the website. It is their responsibility to make the application’s interface attractive and visually stimulating. They also have to ensure that every single visual element feels united both in aesthetics and in purpose. <br>

Importance of UI/UX design <br>
The primary goal of any business or service is to increase its sales and along with it, increase the growth of the business. UI/ UX Design plays an important role in achieving this role. The UI/UX design of an application improves the user experience and customer satisfaction that will help increase the number of users.<br>
As there are a lot of choices and alternatives for the products and services you offer, one gets only a short span of time to grab the user’s attention. UI and UX design helps to win over the consumer’s confidence and make them use your website or application. The number of consumers that one gets on their website can measure the success of UI and UX of the website/application. For a start-up or small business, the importance of UI/ UX design is greater as it can make or break brand recognition. <br>
